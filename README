todo 26/5/2017 -- Write own implementation of gson JsonDeserializer.
    Need to use different models to parse different types of content returned by the iTunes Search Api.
    Need look up more details but seems to depend of the 'wrapperType' value. For instance,
        "wrapperType":"collection" will mean an album. And then it will have another value called "collectionType" set
         to "Album".
